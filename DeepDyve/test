  "body": "\n1 <h5>Introduction<\/h5> <P>Currently, the genus Legionella includes 47 species and more than 60 serogroups (SGs) which are mostly isolated from the environment and differentiated on the basis of their biochemical characteristics and by genetic and serologic analysis. Legionella pneumophila was the first species to be defined and it is comprised of 15 SGs. It is also the most common species isolated from environment such as water of cooling towers and soil (Winn, 1999) , and is responsible for over 80% of reported human infections (Benson and Fields, 1998; Pasculle, 2000) . The second most frequently isolated human pathogen is Legionella micdadei (Nielsen et al., 2000; Waterer et al., 2001) . In fact, the number of species infecting humans continues to increase. To date, 21 species have been isolated from pneumonia patients (Miyamoto et al., 1997; Lo Presti et al., 1997) , which are considered pathogenic to human. These include: L. feeleii , L. anisa , L. bozemanii , L. dumoffii , L. gormanii , and L. longbeachae , and many other. L. parisiensis , L. gormanii , and L. jordanis , which were previously recognized as environmental isolates have been reported to be human pathogens (Lo Presti et al., 1999, 1997) , and L. longbeachae as a major cause of legionellosis in Australia (Montanaro-Punzengruber et al., 1999; Saint and Ho, 1999; Waterer et al., 2001) .<P>Rapid and credible typing of Legionella species is very important for ascertaining community outbreaks or nosocomial infections (Waterer et al., 2001) , and locating infection sources. In general, most of the Legionella species are identified by culture. In addition to the conventional methods of observing growth characteristics, autofluorescence, and pigmentation, which may cause ambiguous results, other methods, such as lipopolysaccharide analysis, alloenzyme typing, outer membrane protein analysis, antigenic determinant analysis, fatty acid profiling, and ubiquinone analysis also have been used to definitively identify Legionella species (Benson and Fields, 1998; Diogo et al., 1999; Winn, 1999; Waterer et al., 2001) . However, these methods require specialized techniques and equipments, which limit their use in the general laboratory. Serological typing of isolates for the most common pathogens can be practically used, but although it may be simple and rapid, cross-reactions between species and the SGs of Legionella may limit its use (Benson and Fields, 1998; Pasculle, 2000) .<P>Molecular methods using 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) (Miyamoto et al., 1997; Grimm et al., 1998; Cloud et al., 2000) , intergenic 16S–23S ribosomal spacer region (ISR) (Hookey et al., 1995; Fry and Harrison, 1998; Riffard et al., 1998) , mip (Koide et al., 1993; Ratcliff et al., 1998; Saint and Ho, 1999) , and gyrA (Feddersen et al., 2000) have been used to rapidly detect and identify Legionella species. Some of these methods have been used for the direct detection of Legionella DNA in clinical and environmental samples (Koide et al., 1993; Miyamoto et al., 1997; De Gheldre et al., 2001) ; moreover, species-specific identification has been conducted by PCR (Grimm et al., 1998; Saint and Ho, 1999) . The molecular methods were adopted because they offered promise as simple tools that could improve the speed, specificity, and sensitivity of identification (Benson and Fields, 1998; Waterer et al., 2001) . PCR-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using 16S rDNA (Bangsborg et al., 1995) , 16S–23S ISR (Hookey et al., 1995) , and transfer DNA-intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) analysis (De Gheldre et al., 2001) have also been performed. Most of these PCR-linked methods were used for the molecular typing of L. pneumophila isolates or for identifying limited numbers of Legionella species; however, they were unable to differentiate many Legionella species (Benson and Fields, 1998; Fry and Harrison, 1998; Riffard et al., 1998; De Gheldre et al., 2001) .<P>In this paper, an rpoB sequence-based identification scheme for 38 Legionella species, and the results of efforts to identify L. pneumophila isolates by PCR-restriction fragment lengh polymophism (PCR-RFLP) analysis are described. The rpoB encodes the RNA polymerase β-subunit (Severinov et al., 1996) and has been used as an identification tool in Mycobacterium (Kim et al., 1999, 2001) , Borrelia (Lee et al., 2000) , Bartonella (Renesto et al., 2001) , Leptospira (Renesto et al., 2000) , and Legionella (Ko et al., 2002) . We used both Legionella genus-specific PCR-RFLP and L. pneumophila species-specific PCR-RFLP using rpoB , as a simple and efficient method, which does not require expensive equipments or specialized techniques, to identify and differentiate Legionella species.<\/P>2 <h5>Materials and methods<\/h5> 2.1 <h5>Strains and DNA preparation<\/h5> <P>Fifty-nine reference strains of 38 species (Table 1) were included in this study to select Legionella genus-specific primers and L. pneumophila species-specific primers for PCR, and restriction analysis. Four reference strains of SG-1 and one each of SG-2 to SG-15 of L. pneumophila , and two each of reference strain in SGs 1 and 2 of L. bozemanii , L. feeleii , L. hackeliae , and L. longbeachae were used. Eighty-two Korean culture isolates were provided by Dr. M.-Y. Park at Korean National Institute of Health (KNIH). Samples were originally isolated from the water of cooling towers (79 strains) and from pneumonia patients (3 strains).<P>DNAs were extracted using the bead-beater-phenol extraction method (13). Briefly, 100 μl of cell suspension was placed with 100 μl of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1) and 100 μl (packed volume) of glass beads in a 2.0-ml screw-capped microcentrifuge tube. To disrupt the cells, the tube was oscillated on a mini-bead beater (Biospec Products) for 30 s at 5000 rpm. The tube was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the aqueous phase transferred to another new tube. DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and dissolved in 60 μl of deionized distilled water. The DNA obtained was used as a template DNA for PCR.<\/P>2.2 <h5>rpoB DNA sequencing<\/h5> <P>A pair of primers (RL1; 5′-GAT GAT ATC GAT CAY CTD GG-3′ and RL2; 5′-TTC VGG CGT TTC AAT NGG AC-3′) was used to amplify partial rpoB DNA (369-bp) that contained the rif r region (Kim et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 2000) , and which were selected from the consensus sequences of Escherichia coli (GenBank accession No. V00340), Coxiella burnetii (U86688), and L. pneumophila (AF087812). Template DNA (ca. 50 ng) and 20 pmol of each primer were added to a PCR mixture tube (AccuPower PCR PreMix; Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea), which contained 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 250 μM, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 40 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and gel loading dye. The final volume was adjusted to 20 μl with distilled water, and the reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification of; 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 55 °C, and 1 min extension at 72 °C, and was followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C (model 9700 Thermocycler; Perkin-Elmer Cetus). Amplified products were detected on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified for sequencing using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The partial DNA sequences of the purified PCR products were directly determined using forward and reverse primers on an Applied Biosystems model 377 automated sequencer and a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). For the sequencing reaction, 30 ng of purified PCR products, 2.5 pmol of primer, and 4 μl of BigDye Terminator RR mix (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems; part no. 4303153) were mixed and adjusted to a final volume of 10 μl with distilled water. The reaction was run with 5% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide for 30 cycles at: 15 s at 95 °C, 5 s at 50 °C, and 4 min at 60 °C.<\/P>2.3 <h516>S rRNA gene sequencing<\/h5> <P>To ascertain the reference strains of Legionella species used in this study, 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR using a primer set, 16F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and 16R (5′-TAC GGC TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) and sequenced as described above for rpoB analysis. A near whole 16S rDNA fragment was amplified. The nucleotide sequences at the 3′-end (∼400-bp) of the amplicons were determined using a reverse primer (16R) and compared with those of the type strains deposited at GenBank.<\/P>2.4 <h5>Legionella genus-specific PCR-RFLP<\/h5> <P>Legionella genus-specific primers were selected by comparing rpoB sequences of 59 Legionella reference strains (GenBank accession numbers AF367721–AF367758, AY036036–AY036052, and AF489905–AF489908) and those of 24 bacteria in the GenBank including Streptococcus pneumoniae , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and C. burnetii . A new reverse primer, RL4 (5′-ACD CGD YCR TAG TGT HGT-3′) was used with RL1 for Legionella genus-specific PCR (347-bp). Conditions for the PCR assay were identical to those described above except for an annealing temperature of 52 °C. Thirteen bacterial species ( Bacillus subtilis , Bacteroides fragilis , Branhamella catarrhalis , Corynebacterium diphtheriae , E. coli , Haemophilus influenzae , Helicobacter pylori , Mycobacterium fortuitum , Neisseria sicca , Nocardia sp. , Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus faecalis , and Streptococcus pyogenes ) were used to confirm the specificity of the primer set.<P>The amplified rpoB DNAs (347-bp) were used for the restriction analysis. Restriction sites on each of the rpoB sequences were identified by a MapDraw program, version 3.14 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) to accurately size the DNA fragments produced by the restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes ( Hae III, Alu I, Cfo I, Pst I, and Mae II; Promega, Madison, WI) that produced the most discernable fragments were selected. Ten microliters of the amplified products was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and digested with restriction enzymes according to the supplier's instructions. Digested DNA fragments were detected by electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel after ethidium bromide staining.<\/P>2.5 <h5>L. pneumophila species-specific PCR-RFLP<\/h5> <P>The L. pneumophila species-specific rpoB DNA (217-bp) was used separately to differentiate subspecies of L. pneumophila by restriction analysis. PCR was performed with a species-specific primer set (RL5; 5′-TCA GTT TAG AGT AGG TCT T-3′ and RL6; 5′-CCC AAG RGC CGA TAC ACG-3′), which was selected by comparing the rpoB sequences of L. pneumophila with those of other Legionella species. PCR conditions were identical as those above except for an annealing temperature of 58 °C and an extension time of 30 s. Restriction analysis using Bam HI (Promega) was performed as above.<\/P>3 <h5>Results<\/h5> 3.1 <h5> Legionella genus-specific PCR<\/h5> <P>rpoB DNAs (347-bp) were successfully amplified from 59 reference strains of Legionella species (Fig. 1A) , with the exception of L. adelaidensis . In the case of L. adelaidensis , a short nonspecifically amplified fragment (∼310 bp) was observed (data not shown). On the other hand, no amplification products were found in the other 13 bacterial species tested, even when the annealing temperature was lowered to 48 °C (Fig. 1B) .<\/P>3.2 <h5>Differentiation of Legionella species by restriction analysis<\/h5> <P>Available restriction enzymes were assessed on the basis of the determined sequences of reference strains by using a computer program. Combinations of successive digestions easily discriminated the Legionella species concerned (Table 2) . A simplified identification scheme is shown in Fig. 5 . Hae III-digestion (GG CC) led to six different PCR-RFLP patterns of the Legionella species (Figs. 4 and 5) . Because three PCR-RFLP groups by Hae III-digestion included two or more species, successive digestions with other enzymes were needed for species differentiation.<P>The amplified DNAs of 10 species, including L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri could not be digested with Hae III. However, they were differentiated by one or two more restriction enzymes. L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri , L. jordanis , L. anisa , and L. gratiana were differentiated by Alu I digestion. The others, L. tucsonensis , L. oakridgensis , L. sainthelensi , L. israelensis , L. londiniensis , and L. jamestownensis , were separable by using enzymes, such as, Cfo I (GCG↓C), Pst I (CTGCA↓G), and Mae II (A↓CGT). However, strains showing a single band (347-bp) by Hae III and two bands (204/143-bp) by Alu I (AG↓CT), such as, L. jamestownensis and L. londiniensis , needed Mae II digestion to allow them to be distinguished ( Table 2 and Fig. 5 ).<P>The largest group included 24 species, and represented restriction patterns (275/72-bp, 276/71-bp, and 273/74-bp) indiscernible by Hae III digestion. Many of the important human pathogens, except for L. gormanii , were in this group, and included L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila , L. micdadei , L. dumoffii , L. bozemanii , and L. longbeachae (Figs. 4 and 5) . Species in this group could also be discriminated by successive digestion with one or more restriction enzymes. Of these, L. micdadei , L. maceachernii , L. birminghamensis , L. adelaidensis , and L. lansingensis showed distinct restriction patterns upon Alu I digestion. L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila , L. feeleii and L. longbeachae showed the same Hae III and Alu I (268/79-bp) restriction patterns as L. brunensis . However, they were successfully separated by a third enzyme ( Cfo I). While L. brunensis was not digested, L. feeleii and L. longbeachae were cleaved into 215/132-bp and 256/91-bp fragments, respectively. L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila showed 240/107-bp DNA by Cfo I digestion. L. bozemanii , L. parisiensis and L. shakespearei shared identical restriction patterns when digested by Hae III, Alu I, Cfo I, and Pst I. However, they were differentiated by Mae II-digestion ( Table 2 and Fig. 5 ).<P>L. gormanii and L. steigerwaltii showed an identical Hae III restriction pattern (201/74/72-bp) (Fig. 4) but were differentiated by Alu I-digestion (Fig. 5) . L. gormanii DNA was cleaved into two fragments (243/104-bp), while L. steigerwaltii was not. Distinctive Hae III restriction patterns of nonpathogenic species, such as L. fairfieldensis (268/79-bp), L. spiritensis (275/46/26-bp) and L. geestiana (273/52/22-bp), allowed direct identification.<P>Genetically or phenotypically close subspecies and species can be distinguished by rpoB PCR-RFLP. Restriction with any one of, Hae III, Alu I, Cfo I, and Mae II easily distinguished between the two subspecies of L. pneumophila . In addition, two red autofluorescent species, L. erythra and L. rubriluscens , which were not easily differentiated by 16S rDNA sequence analysis (Hookey et al., 1996) or by intergenic 16S–23S rDNA sequence length polymorphism analysis (Hookey et al., 1995; Riffard et al., 1998) , were distinguished. Although they showed identical restriction patterns by Hae III- and Alu I-digestion, their Cfo I restriction patterns were different ( L. erythra [256/91-bp] and L. rubriluscens [256/47/44-bp]) (Fig. 5) . Blue–white autofluorescent species, for example, L. anisa , L. bozemanii , L. tucsonensis , L. parisiensis , L. dumoffii , and L. steigerwaltii , which could not be discriminated easily by other methods (Hookey et al., 1995; De Gheldre et al., 2001; Fry and Harrison, 1998) , were also differentiated well by two to four restriction enzyme digestions (Fig. 5) .<\/P>3.3 <h5>Differentiation of L. pneumophila subspecies by species-specific PCR-RFLP<\/h5> <P>In addition to Legionella genus-specific PCR-RFLP, another PCR-RFLP method was used to specifically identify and distinguish L. pneumophila subspecies, namely, L. pneumophila species-specific PCR-RFLP. PCR products (217 bp) were observed only from the 18 reference strains (15 SGs) of L. pneumophila , while nothing was amplified from other Legionella species (Fig. 2) and non-Legionellae strains (data not shown). In contrast to the undigested single band of L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri , the PCR product of L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila was cleaved into two fragments (136/81 bp) by Bam HI (G GATCC) treatment (Fig. 3) . According to a previous report, three strains (ATCC 33156 [SG-4], ATCC 33215 [SG-5], and ATCC 35351 [SG-15]) among the 18 reference strains of L. pneumophila used in this study, belong to L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri and the others to L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila (Brenner et al., 1988) . The Bam HI restriction analysis of these reference strains produced results compatible with the previous findings (Fig. 3) .<\/P>3.4 <h5>Identification of culture isolates<\/h5> <P>Eighty-two Korean culture isolates were identified using both Legionella genus-specific and L. pneumophila species-specific PCR-RFLP methods. The rpoB DNAs (347-bp) were amplified from all of the isolates by Legionella genus-specific PCR suggesting that they belong to the genus Legionella . However, 217-bp DNAs were amplified only from 79 isolates by L. pneumophila species-specific PCR. These were further identified as L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila (68 strains, 86.1%) or L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri (11 strains, 13.9%) by Legionella genus-specific PCR-RFLP ( Hae III, Alu I, and Cfo I) (Fig. 5) . Nothing was amplified from the other three isolates by L. pneumophila species-specific PCR.<P>Three strains, which were previously identified as L. feeleii (K9951 and K9952) and L. bozemanii (K9953) by serological testing, showed distinctive restriction patterns. According to the genus-specific PCR-RFLP results, they seemed to be either one of L. parisiensis , L. bozemanii or L. shakespearei showing two fragments (275/72-bp) by Hae III and an undigested single band by Alu I, Cfo I, and Pst I restriction. However, their Mae II restriction patterns were similar but quite different from those of other species. Mae II cleaved their amplicons into three fragments (230/89/28-bp), whereas L. shakespearei , L. parisiensis , and L. bozemanii each generated four or more fragments ( Table 2 ; Fig. 5 ). Thus, their patterns did not correspond to any other Legionella species analyzed. Furthermore, rpoB DNA was not amplified from those strains by L. pneumophila species-specific PCR (217 bp). Therefore, although they must lie within the boundary of the genus Legionella in terms of rpoB and 16S rDNA sequence similarities and phylogenetic analyses (data not shown), they did not belong to any Legionella species published to date.<P>All of the results of the L. pneumophila species-specific PCR-RFLPs performed on the 79 culture isolates were concordant with those of Legionella genus-specific PCR-RFLP. By observing the cleaved DNA fragments (136/81 bp) by Bam HI digestion, 68 strains (86.1%), including three human isolates were identified as L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila . The other 11 strains (13.9%) were identified as L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri .<\/P>4 <h5>Discussion<\/h5> <P>Different methods have been used to detect Legionella species in environmental or clinical sources (Winn, 1999; Waterer et al., 2001) . Although isolation and identification by culture is a reliable method with high specificity and sensitivity, methods using specific antibodies and PCR have been introduced for direct detection and identification, which can reduce the identification procedure. However, in the case of the serological methods, it is not easy to equip the antisera to all of the Legionella species currently recognized. Serologic methods are also usually impeded by the cross-reactivity of antibodies and have been applied mainly to L. pneumophila (Benson and Fields, 1998; Pasculle, 2000) . By comparison, PCR-linked methods have several advantages. For example, they not only allow the rapid and effective detection, but also specific identification (Benson and Fields, 1998; Nielsen et al., 2000) . In particular, when discriminatory phenotypic testing for Legionella species is difficult (Benson and Fields, 1998) , genetic analyses based on PCR or PCR-linked methods offer dependable alternatives.<P>Although false positive reactions have been reported (Jaulhac et al., 1992) , PCR and PCR-linked methods have the capability of being species specific (Benson and Fields, 1998) . The 16S rDNA, mip , intergenic rRNA spacer, and the 5S rRNA gene have been used for this purpose (Lindsay et al., 1994; Bangsborg et al., 1995; Hookey et al., 1995; Fry and Harrison, 1998; Riffard et al., 1998; De Gheldre et al., 2001) . However, 16S rDNA was too conserved to discriminate between all Legionella species (Hookey et al., 1996; Lo Presti et al., 1999) , and intergenic rRNA spacer showed ambiguities in terms of their interpretation (Hookey et al., 1995; Fry and Harrison, 1998; Riffard et al., 1998) . Particularly, 5S rDNA in combination with mip was used in a commercially available kit (EnviroAmp kit, PE, Foster City, CA). Members of genus Legionella and/or L. pneumophila can be detected by a combination of PCR and subsequent hybridization to probes (Miyamoto et al., 1997; Benson and Fields, 1998) . Either L. pneumophila or other members of the genus Legionella can be simultaneously detected. However, because of the highly conservative trait of 5S rDNA it cannot be used for the further differentiation of Legionella species (Benson and Fields, 1998) .<P>In this study, we demonstrated an rpoB PCR-RFLP scheme for the specific detection and identification of the 38 Legionella species including two subspecies of L. pneumophila . PCR-RFLP is a simple and convenient method, which successfully applied to differentiate all the reference strains of the 38 Legionella species tested. Sensitive and specific detection of Legionella species was achieved by specific PCR using genus- or species-specific primers. By comparing the 59 rpoB sequences with those of other bacteria, Legionella genus-specific primers (RL1–RL4) and L. pneumophila species-specific primers (RL5–RL6) were selected. The specificity of each specific primer was proven by PCR, which was performed upon 12 bacterial DNAs, which are unrelated to Legionella . Exceptionally, a short amplified product, which seemed to be nonspecific, was observed in L. adelaidensis by the Legionella genus-specific PCR (data not shown). This might have resulted from the presence of sequences similar to RL4 at the upstream, which was identified by sequence comparison. Species identification was performed by subsequent restriction analysis of specifically amplified DNA.<P>The usefulness of the rpoB PCR-RFLP scheme is obvious in that closely related Legionella species, which were not clearly differentiated in other methods, were easily differentiated using this method. For example, by tDNA-ILP analysis (De Gheldre et al., 2001) , four species ( L. anisa , L. bozemanii , L. tucsonensis , and L. parisiensis ) of the blue–white autofluorescence group showed very similar patterns, and the two red autofluorescent species, L. erythra and L. rubriluscens were not included. Also, by ISR length polymorphism analysis, 10 blue–white autofluorescent species were not clearly discriminated, and L. longbeachae , L. gratiana , and L. oakridgensis showed similar band patterns (Fry and Harrison, 1998; Riffard et al., 1998) . Moreover, L. erythra and L. rubriluscens displayed identical 16S–23S ISR-PCR patterns (Hookey et al., 1995; Riffard et al., 1998) . However, these species were differentiated well in the rpoB PCR-RFLP. The two red autofluorescent species, L. erythra and L. rubriluscens , which share a 99.4% 16S rDNA sequence similarity (Hookey et al., 1996) , and identical PCR patterns by 16S–23S ISR (Hookey et al., 1995; Riffard et al., 1998) , were simply differentiated by Cfo I and Mae II ( Table 2 ; Fig. 5 ). In addition, several blue–white autofluorescent species were also discriminated without ambiguity.<P>The utility of rpoB PCR-RFLP methods was demonstrated again when they were applied to culture isolates. As shown in Fig. 2 , L. pneumophila species-specific PCR efficiently identified L. pneumophila . PCR product (217 bp) was observed only from all SGs of L. pneumophila , and not from other Legionella species. From 79 culture isolates, 217-bp rpoB DNAs were amplified by L. pneumophila species-specific PCR suggesting that they are L. pneumophila . Results of Legionella genus-specific PCR-RFLP supported this result, and they were definitely identified as being L. pneumophila by the sequence analysis of partial 16S rDNA and rpoB .<P>Another good example of the usefulness is the identification of a new Legionella species candidate. The restriction patterns of three culture isolates (K9951, K9952, and K9953) did not correspond to any one of the proposed rpoB identification scheme in this study. In addition, the L. pneumophila species-specific PCR products (217 bp) were not observed. However, judging from the sequence similarities of 16S rDNA (91.5 to 95.8%) and rpoB (76.3 to 85.0%) with those of Legionella species reported so far, they seemed to be within the genus Legionella . Tentatively, they were identified as belonging to a novel Legionella species, and thus, a phenotypic study is now underway.<P>In addition, L. pneumophila , which is the most common and important human pathogen, was further differentiated into two subspecies by both rpoB PCR-RFLP methods. In most previous studies, even using the mip sequence-based classification scheme (Ratcliff et al., 1998) , subspecies of L. pneumophila have not been differentiated (Bangsborg et al., 1995; Hookey et al., 1995; Fry and Harrison, 1998; Riffard et al., 1998; Cloud et al., 2000; De Gheldre et al., 2001) . Protein electrophoresis analysis (Selander et al., 1985; Brenner et al., 1988) proved to be the exception. Basically, L. pneumophila is sub-divided into three subspecies. While L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila is the most frequently found and covers all SGs, L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri is found in SG-1, -4, -5, and -15. L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei is only represented in SG-5, and rarely found (Selander et al., 1985; Brenner et al., 1988) . Among the 18 reference strains of L. pneumophila used in this study, three strains belonged to L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri and the others to L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila (Table 1) . According to the comparative rpoB sequence analysis two subspecies showed high genetic divergence (10.3–12.7% sequence dissimilarities) (Ko et al., 2002) . Thus, simple methods seem to be necessary to distinguish subspecies in epidemiological study. Among the culture isolates, L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila and L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri account for 86.1% and 13.9% of 79 Korean isolates, respectively. These values do not vary remarkably from the other previously published reports on population studies, e.g., 80.6% and 14.5% (Selander et al., 1985) , and 66.7% and 28.3% (Brenner et al., 1988) . Unfortunately, isolates of L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei , which is rare and only found in aquatic environments (Selander et al., 1985; Brenner et al., 1988) , were not available in this study.<P>The present study demonstrated that rpoB PCR-RFLP can efficiently differentiate L. pneumophila subspecies and rapidly identify 38 Legionella species. Pathogenic species, such as L. pneumophila , L. micdadei , L. bozemanii , L. gormanii , L. dumoffii , and L. longbeachae , were differentiated well from other species by successive digestion with restriction enzymes. These results show that rpoB PCR-RFLP is a convenient method for the specific detection and rapid identification of Legionella species from the environmental and clinical samples. When one considers that there are many Legionella species and that newly defined species are being increasingly reported (Hookey et al., 1996; Lo Presti et al., 1999) , we suggest that Legionella genus-specific PCR-RFLP be used first to detect and identify species, and that L. pneumophila species-specific PCR-RFLP be used to confirm and identify L. pneumophila .<\/P>\n",

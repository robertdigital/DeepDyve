I used natural language processing to determine if I could improve the quality of information retrieval for a document repository containing academic articles and journals.  I used raw document texts as a starting point.

To enable semantic results that were not completely related to the keyword, I used Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to cluster documents into related topics.

As a followup, I also employed neural network training (Doc2Vec) to see if I could get better results than LSI.

LSI provided the most relevant results better matching the keywords, with Doc2Vec producing more inconsistent results probably due to a lack of model tuning.

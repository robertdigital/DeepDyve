# DSI Capstone Project Rubric
This document describes how to evaluate capstone projects, and sets a minimum bar required for graduation.

## Evaluation of Capstone Projects
The capstone project should demonstrate that the student has mastered the material in DSI and can apply the tools and techniques to a real world problem, while exercising good judgement and following industry best practices.   

#### A good project has the following properties:
* Follows a recognized workflow such as CRISP-DM (20/100):
  * Answers a well-posed business problem or research question
  * Uses appropriate data:  i.e., the question and data are compatible
  * Uses a suitable methodology
  * Evaluates the methodology
  * Should be reproducible
* Business/Research Question (20/100):
  * Appropriate scope
  * Does it have the appropriate level of difficulty for a two week problem
  * Does the student have suitable data to answer their question?  If not, can they obtain this data?
  * If the problem could not be solved with ‘ideal’ data, it should be rejected
* Data (20/100):
  * Completes EDA:
  * What are strengths & weaknesses of data?
  * Handles outliers?
  * Handles missing values?
  * Class imbalance?
  * Data should be sufficiently complex so that the problem is not trivial
  * Data should not be so complex that the problem cannot be solved in a two weeks timeframe
* Model (20/100) - If model is used
  * Did the student use a model which is applicable to the data/problem?
  * Did they follow best practice for using the model?
* Evaluation (20/100) - If model is used
  * Did the student evaluate the model?
  * For causal questions, did they use inference?  For predictive projects, did they use (k-fold) cross validation and the correct metric(s)  For recommenders, prediction at n & recall at n
  * Did they interpret the results?

## Requirements for graduation


* Work is the student’s
  * Plagiarism is an automatic failure
  * Work which is not the student’s must be cited correctly
* Repo requirements
  * Must follow every section of Code Cleanup and README requirements in [designing_your_repo](designing_your_repo.md)
